# README
## Project
PROJECT ON HALT UNTIL API KEY HAS BEEN APPROVED.

My buddy Matthijs really wanted a README so he could understand the code eventhough its written like an epilogue of Stephen King's latest books.

This Discord bot is used to incorporate the RIOT API to fetch user data and periodically send it to discord. Furthermore, using a redis cache users can be stored in-memory and be fetched quickly. 

## Docker
Docker support will be added.


## Language Model
One of the desired features is to train a language model, probably a seq2seq model to immitate the behaviour of people within the discord.
